project requirements:
    user input: accept name of a book
    output: display list of similar books
    Interactivity: Provide a user-friendly interface

Development Environment
Choose a programming language (e.g., Python(backend and model), JavaScript).
Decide on a web framework (e.g., Flaskfor Python, Express for Node.js).
Set up a version control system, like Git.

Backend Development
    Data Source: data is present in data.csv
    Recommendation Algorithm: Implement an algorithm to find similar books. Options include:
        Content-based filtering (based on book attributes).
        Collaborative filtering (based on user interactions).
        Hybrid methods.
    API Development: Create RESTful endpoints to handle:
        Book search.
        Fetching similar books.

Frontend Development
    Framework/Library: React
    UI Design: Design a modern and responsive user interface.
    Interactivity: Implement features like:
    Search bar for book input.
    Display area for similar books.
    Loading indicators and error messages.

Integration
    Connect the frontend with the backend using AJAX or Fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval.
    Ensure smooth data flow and error handling between the client and server.

Testing
    Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions.
    Integration Testing: Ensure the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.
    User Testing: Gather feedback from real users to improve usability.
